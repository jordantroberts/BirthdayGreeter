#### Birthday Greeter App

## Task

Your challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

* wish the user happy birthday
* tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

## Domain Model

## Using the program

1. Clone the repo
2. Run 'bundle install'
3. Run 'rackup' and visit the localhost:[port number]

You should be taken to this view:

When you click 'submit' you should be informed how many days left until your birthday! :)

If it's your birthday today (happy birthday) then you should instead be greeted with a Happy Birthday message:
